# Sudoku-Game
I recently developed a Sudoku game that incorporates various features to enhance the user experience. The game utilizes a backtracking algorithm to generate unique and solvable puzzles. This ensures that every puzzle presented to the player is carefully crafted to offer an enjoyable and challenging experience.

One of the notable features of my Sudoku game is the inclusion of a timer. This adds a competitive element to the game, allowing players to challenge themselves and strive for faster completion times. It also appeals to users who enjoy tracking their progress and setting personal records.

To accommodate players of different skill levels, I incorporated a difficulty selection option. This feature enables users to choose between different levels of complexity, ranging from easy to hard. By doing so, I aimed to cater to both novice players who are new to Sudoku and experienced enthusiasts seeking a more demanding gameplay experience.

The game's interface is intuitive and user-friendly, with an aesthetically pleasing design that enhances the overall gaming experience. I focused on providing a clean layout that allows players to easily navigate through the grid and input their answers without any confusion or hindrance.

Under the hood, the game utilizes a backtracking algorithm to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles. This algorithm ensures that each puzzle is solvable and avoids any ambiguous or unsolvable situations. By implementing this logic, I aimed to provide users with an authentic Sudoku experience that stays true to the rules and principles of the game.

Overall, my Sudoku game combines a robust backtracking algorithm, a timer feature, difficulty levels, and a user-friendly interface to create an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for players of all skill levels.
